**Situation**

You are a team of freelance data analysts and have been commissioned by Wucher, an online department store, to analyse their sales data. Wucher wants you to investigate on their customers’ purchasing behaviour and to make recommendations on how to increase revenue.

For Wuchers’ executives, the following questions are of particular interest:

- Which product categories generate the most sales? Which ones the least? Generally, how do different categories compare?
- What role does the customer’s location play? Are there particularly interesting regions?
- How did purchasing behaviour change over time for exemplary customers?
- In what way did the store’s total revenue change over time, and why?

If there are additional valuable insights gained from the analysis, feel free to include them in your results.

**Output**

Your results should be presented in an up-to 10-minute presentation. It should be addressed to the management of the respective company.
